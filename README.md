# OlcbRefresh
#### **WARNING** This code is in development.  AT90CAN appears to work.  Others not tested.  
This is a refresh of the Arduino base libs, ie OlcbStarLibraries.  

It is meant to simplify and extend the Arduino code.

## Changes: 
1. Added support for multiple processors: Arduino, Teensy, Tiva. 
   - Each set of files specific to a CAN-processor is kept in its own directory.   
   - The processor is automatically selected in the processor.h file. 
2. A sorted index[] into eventids[] is used to speed eventID processing, using qsort() and bsearch().  
3. Simplified the definition of CDI/xml for the node by matching a struct{} to the xml structure, see the example below.   

e.g.: This CDI/xml, which self-describes the node to the system:
```xml
    <cdi>
        ...
        <group replication='8'>
        <name>Channels</name>
            <eventid><name>event0</name></eventid>
            <eventid><name>event1</name></eventid>
            <int size='1'><name>Rate</name></int>
        </group>
        ...
    </cdi>
```
parallels this program structure:    
```c++
    typedef struct {
        ...
        struct {
            EventID event0;
            EventID event1;
            uint8_t rate;
        } channels[8];
        ...
    } MemStruct;
    Memstruct *pmem;
```
The system constant parts of these two items are provided, and only the user-app parts are needed in the sketch.  'pmem' is used to retrieve offsets within Memstruct, and the macro EEADDR(x) returns this offset, which is useful in code to refer to and manipulate Memstruct fields.  

For example, **EEADDR(channels[0].rate)** will return the offset to that item in Memstruct, and it can be used to retrieve its value: **int r = EEPROM.get(EEADDR(channels[0].rate))**.  


## Memory Model:
Only eventIDs are copied to RAM into the eventids[] array.  <br>
#### In Flash:<br>
**EIDTab[]** holds the offset of each eventID into the EEPROM and RAM struct{}, and the associated flags indicating P/C.<br>
    It is initialized at compile-time using three macros: **CEID()**, **PEID()**, and **PCEID()**.
    Fore example, **CEID(channels.event0)** provides the memory offset to teh event, and indicates it is a consumer-event.  
#### In RAM:
**eventidIndex[]** contains sorted index into **eventidOffset[]**.<br>
    It is sorted on the hash values.  
**event[]** contains run-time flags, used to indicate P/C, learning, and eventids to be transmitted to the net.  

In the medium model *only*, **eventids[]** contains a copy of the node's eventIDs, and is indexed by eventidIndex[].

This restated as a diagram:
```
                       +--> (index) -->eventid[].flags
        eventIndex[] --+--> (index) -->event[].flags
                       +--> (index) -->EIDTab[] --(offset)--> mem[] or EEPROM[]
```

## More about OpenLCB/LCC - what is it?

OpenLCB/LCC is a set of heirarchical protocols to **let nodes talk to each other**. <br>
For more information on OpenLCB, see: [OpenLCB.org](http://openlcb.org)<br>
For protocol descriptions, see: [Adopted LCC Documents](http://openlcb.org/openlcb-and-lcc-documents/layout-command-control-lcc/)

These protocols consist of: 
 - **Systems/Application Messaging**<br>
    These are the 'workhorse' messages on which most applications will be built, they are useful for sytems-messaging as well, and for building further systems-protocols.  
   - PCE - Produver/Consumer Event Messages
     - These are *unaddressed* EventID messages.
     - They implement *Producer/Consumer Events* (64-bit)
     - EventIDs are globally unique 64-bit numbers.
     - These are one-to-many messages.
   - Datagram Messages
     - These are *addressed* messages containing up to 70-bytes of data in a single message.
     - These are one-to-one messages.
   - Stream Messages
     - These are *addressed* messages carrying unlimited data in multiple messages.
     - These are one-to-one messages.
 - **Systems/Housekeeping**<br>
    These are the 'behind-the-scenes' protocol that enables and ensures the system's integrity. 
   - Link - establishes and maintains the node's link to the network
     - Announces state of Node
     - Announcement of *Intialization Complete*
     - Announcement of *Consumed-* and *Produced-eventIDs*
     - *NodeID reporting* on request.
     - *EventID reporting* on request.
     - On the CAN-implementation, this maintains *alias assignment and maintenance*;
   - SNIP - Simple Node Information Protocol
     - Provides a brief description of the node for *UI Tools* to use.
   - PIP - Protocol Identification Protocol
     - Defines which protocols the node uses, and it is reported as a bit-map.  
   - CDI - Configuration Description Information
     - *Reports the node's CDI/xml* on request.
   - Memory Configuration
     - Reading and writing to the node's memory spaces, including Configuration, RAM and EEPROM spaces.
 - **Additional Protocols**<br>
    These protocols extend the base-system.
   - Teaching -- teaching an eventID from one node to one or more others.  
   - Traction Control -- train control.
 - **Additional Utility-Libraries**<br>
    These libraries implement useful functionality.  
   - BG - Blue/Green -- node health indicators and system buttons.
   - ButtonLed -- implements controlling a button and LED from a single processor pin.

## How the Above Translates to the Codebase
The 'codebase' is a set of libraries and functions that implement the basic protocols of OpenLCB/LCC. <br> 
Each protocol has corresponding **code**, usually in the form of a **class**, and implemented as a pair of *.h and *.cpp  files. <br> 
The codebase tries to hide some of the complexity in #include files.  <br>

However, each protocol needs to have: 
 - **initialization**, and
 - **processing**
    
For example there are some selected lines of code from the OlcbBasicNode example used for **initialization**: 
```c++
  NodeID nodeid(5,1,1,1,3,255);    // This node's default ID; must be valid 
  const char SNII_const_data[] PROGMEM = "\001OpenLCB\000DPHOlcbBasicNode\0001.0\000" OlcbCommonVersion ; 
  uint8_t protocolIdentValue[6] = {0xD7,0x58,0x00,0,0,0};
  ButtonLed* buttons[] = { &pA,&pA,&pB,&pB,&pC,&pC,&pD,&pD };
```
Most of the **processing** is hidden as functions in the #include files.  

## How Does the Application Interact with the Codebase?
The programmer of the Application must: 
 - Decide what and how the new Application works, ie how eventids and other node variables are used to build the Application.  
 - Choose the **NodeID** - this must be from **a range controlled** by the manufacturer - **ie you**.  
 - Write the **CDI/xml** describing the node and its node-variables, including its eventIDs. 
 - Write a **MemStruct{}** that matches the xml description.  
 - Define **EIDTab** to flag each eventID as a **Producer, Consumer, or Both** by using **CEID**, **PEID**, and **PCEID**.  
 - Write **pceCallback()**, which processes received eventIDs, ie eventIDs to be consumed, and causing whatever action is required, eg a LED being lit or extinguished.  
 - Write **produceFromInputs()** which scans the node's inputs and, if appropriate, flags an evenItD to be sent.  
 - Write **userConfigWrite()** which is called whenever a UI Tool writes to the node's memory.  This code can then compare the memory address range of the change to the node's variables, and take whatever action is appropriate, e.g. update a servo position.
 - Write additional support and glue code for the Application.  

## Example Applications
The provided examples will give some ideas of how to accomplish sample projects.  They can form the basis of, or  be adapted to, a new Application, or just used for inspiration.  
 - **OlcbBasicNode**<br>
    Implements a simple node which exercises most of the protocols.  It has **two inputs** and **two outputs**.  Each input has two Producer-eventIDs and each output has two Consumer-eventIDs, so 8 eventIDs in total.  This Application makes use of the ButtonLed library to control **two buttons** and **two LEDs**.  In addition, it implements the BG (Blue-Gold) protocol to allow the **teaching** of eventIDs between this node and others.  
- **OlcbServoPCA8695**<br>
    Implements driving a number of servos from a PCA8695 PWM chip.  It shows how to write a different **pceCallback()**.  It also uses **userConfigWrite()** to allow real-time updating of a servo positions from a **UI Tool**, such as **JMRI** or **Model Railroad System**.
